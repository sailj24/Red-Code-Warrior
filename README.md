# Red-Code-Warrior
Red Code Warrior for CoreWar- Built Fall 2020
name: Railgun
author: CodeSharks
strategy: Implements Coreclear by iterating dat bombs in all blocks that are not the the program, causing all opponent processes to crash.
The code iterates through the core and skips over itself, resetting its count to the block proceeding the program.

The Railgun strategy does well against other iterative warriors (Vamp), as it quickly overtakes
its opponent. However, the speed costs it mobility, making a sitting duck, albeit small. 
Generally, its success is determined by it's ability to reach it's opponent before the opponent can affect it.
