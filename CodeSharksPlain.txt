;strategy Implements Coreclear by iterating dat bombs 
;strategy in all blocks that are not the the 
;strategy program, causing all opponent processes to 
;strategy crash. The code iterates through the core and 
;strategy skips over itself, resetting its count to 
;strategy to the block proceeding the program.

;evaluation Railgun does well against other iterative
;evaluation warriors (Vamp), as it quickly overtakes
;evaluation its opponent. However, the speed costs it
;evaluation mobility, making a sitting duck, albeit 
;evaluation small. Generally, its success is determined
;evaluation by it's ability to reach it's opponent
;evaluation before the opponent can affect it.
